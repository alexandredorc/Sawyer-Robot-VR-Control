@brief This project aims to connect a Virtual Reality (VR) system to a Sawyer robot, enabling users to control the robot arm by moving their own arms and interacting with the environment using a human hand gripping end effector. It aims to provide a seamless interface for intuitive control and precise manipulation of objects, opening up possibilities for remote manual labor activities and improving safety and efficiency in various domains.

## Project Backgroud

This project was undertaken as part of the Robotic Studio 2 course at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). This project was a collective effort where Alexandre Dorcival and Issam Syed, over the span of 12 weeks.

## Features and Functionalities

-   Intuitive Control: Users can intuitively control the robot's movements by mirroring their own arm motions, providing a natural and immersive control experience.

-   Precise Object Manipulation: The system enables precise manipulation of objects, allowing users to perform tasks such as picking up and moving items with accuracy and finesse.

-   Remote Control Capabilities: The project focuses on enabling remote control of the Sawyer robot, allowing operators to perform tasks from a different room or location, increasing flexibility and safety.

-   Reusability and Adaptability: The project's design allows for reusability in various applications, making it adaptable to different use cases and allowing users to customize and extend its functionality as per their requirements.

-   Safety Measure: The robot is equipped with safety mechanisms keep the movement under a given velocity limits, moves outside pre-programmed boundaries, or to prevent collisions with predefined objects in the environment.

-   Low Latency and Lag: Efforts have been made to minimize input lag and latency, providing a responsive and seamless experience when controlling the Sawyer robot with the VR controllers.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the README file instructions.

## Usage Examples

This project has several potential usage examples that showcase its versatility and practicality. In a laboratory setting, the system can be used to perform high-level manipulations involving hazardous substances, allowing operators to eliminate risks and perform tasks remotely using the robot's arms. Surgeons could benefit from the project's capabilities by remotely controlling the robot to perform precise surgical procedures with enhanced accuracy and reduced risks. In manufacturing and construction, the system can assist workers in handling heavy objects and performing repetitive tasks, reducing physical strain and increasing productivity.
